League of Legends: Mastery Calculator
======================================

This project was designed to experiment with the new mastery changes that came
with season 2 and has now been updated for season 3. It features a very fast
interface with fully functional talent trees that work as you would expect in
game. Each point you change will automatically alter the URL to provide a unique
link so that you may share a build with other players. The calculator does not
rely on any server technology, and thus may be saved and used offline if
desired.

The season 6 version features mousewheel support, new mastery system, and 
(optionally) sound support. Treat it as a work-in-progress. Considering it has
been worked on by three different people who never communicated with one another,
it should provide the authentic LoL client experience.
